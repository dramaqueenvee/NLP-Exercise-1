# NLP-Exercise-1
Testing if Zipf's Law of Abbreviation holds in English and Catalan in song lyrics. This linguistic law (also called brevity law) expresses that the more frequent a word is, the shorter it will be; and the opposite, the less frequent a word is, the longer it will be. This brief project tests if the law holds in song lyrics, an artistic textual genre, in two languages: English and Catalan.
